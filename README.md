# My-Quiz
Hi this is my attempt at a quiz application. The user is provided a page with a button under the header to start the quiz. When you click the button you are presented with a multiple choice question, click the answer and you are moved to the next question until you complete all 5. I played around with the timer element but for some reason it would stick to "Time : 60 seconds" even though i had changed it to 30 and would not countdown.In the console it would show that the timer was working and once done, the quiz ends. please let me know what changes to make to ensure i receive the full marks. Thank You!
